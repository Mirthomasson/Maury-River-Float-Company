			<div class="description">
				<p>
					Traveling interstate 81, you get a quick look at the Maury River just
					north of Lexington as it passes beneath a bridge underneath your
					wheels. If you’re traveling U. S. 11 instead of the interstate, you
					get a more intimate look at the river. But neither perspective gives
					you a true picture of this fast mountain stream that offers so much to
					so many outdoorsmen. Nor would the traveler who looks upstream or down
					know that the river gathers it headwaters miles to the north beyond U.
					S. Highway 250 which snakes through the rugged mountains between the
					western Virginia towns of Churchville and Monterey. Small mountain
					streams, many of which hold native brook trout join to form the
					Calfpasture River which merges with the Little Calfpasture River just
					west of Goshen Pass. There the Maury River is born. The water of the
					two major tributaries barely have time to mingle before the Maury
					enters the famous Goshen Pass and begins a turbulent run downstream,
					dropping as much as 20 feet in one 100 yard stretch of the river. Once
					through the Pass the river drops into the valley, continuing toward
					Lexington at a fast pace. It maintains that rate of flow, except where
					man intervened, until it enters the James River at Glasgow. Unlike
					most Virginia rivers the Maury is contained entirely within Rockbridge
					County. It does not cross any county lines. While nature designed the
					Maury as a fast flowing stream from its headwaters to the confluence
					with the James, several dams have changed its personality. A 20-foot
					tall dam near Buena Vista impounds the fast water forming a stretch of
					calm water upstream. The Maury River is fairly short by most
					standards. From the confluence of the Calfpasture and the Little
					Calfpasture Rivers, it’s approximately 30 miles to its confluence with
					the James River. En route it brushes the charming cities of Lexington
					and Buena Vista. While there is challenging whitewater such as Devil’s
					Kitchen and other rapids too difficult for the novice to tackle, the
					river offers plenty of Class I and II water that the average canoeist
					or kayaker can handle. In addition to the fast water at Goshen Pass,
					there are the remains of Goose Neck Dam downstream from Buena Vista
					that require care. This is Class II+ water. The names of rivers often
					raise questions from serious river lovers. How did the river get that
					name? Sometimes there’s an explanation, sometimes none. There is,
					however, an explanation for this one. The Maury River was first called
					the North River of the James. It enters the James River from the
					north. But then came Matthew Fontaine Maury, a professor at Virginia
					Military Institute in the years following the Civil War during which
					he had served in the Confederate forces. In those postwar years he
					fell in love with Goshen Pass and requested that at his death his
					remains be carried through the pass and on to Richmond for burial. An
					honor guard of Virginia Military Institute cadets carried out his
					wish. A monument in his honor now rest on the side of Virginia Primary
					Highway 39 where it passed through Goshen Pass. And the river was
					named for him. Obviously the Maury River gets a lot of attention from
					whitewater canoeists and kayakers, primarily because of the Goshen
					Pass wild water. Most of this kind of river recreational use occurs
					during the colder months when the river is high. During the dry months
					of summer the river in this section is too low to canoe or even use a
					kayak. The only exception comes when heavy rainfall in the watershed
					of the river raise its level significantly – even if for only a day or
					so. Thanks to the Goshen-Little North Mountain Wildlife Management
					Area, there is public access to the river through most of Goshen Pass.
					Virginia Primary Highway 39 follows the river and provides access in
					places. Downstream the river is considered a public waterway from
					Lexington to its mouth. While part of that section of the river
					brushes the George Washington National Forest, it is well to keep in
					mind that most of it flows through private land. Leaving the river to
					go ashore on private property is trespassing unless you have prior
					approval.
